# Interpretation of Mental Health Using Machine Learning

# Project Overview

This project aims to predict mental health conditions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing survey data and other relevant factors, the model can help identify individuals who may benefit from mental health support. The primary goal is to create a tool that assists in early detection and intervention, potentially improving the well-being of many individuals.

# Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation
Model Deployment using Flask (optional)
Data Description
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from various sources such as mental health surveys, Kaggle datasets, or other publicly available mental health data repositories. The data typically includes features such as age, gender, work-related factors, past mental health conditions, and responses to survey questions related to mental health.

# Usage

**Data Preprocessing**

Loaded and clean the dataset.
Handled missing values and encode categorical features.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Generated visualizations to understand data distributions and correlations.

**Feature Engineering**

Created new features if necessary.
Selected the most relevant features for the model.

**Model Training**

Splitted the data into training and testing sets.
Trained various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
Tuned hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

**Evaluation**

Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
